Parramatta-Dashboard
====================

University of Western Sydney internship task; Parramatta Dashboard

The intention is to visualise Parramatta as a City in Transition, past present future etc., utilising available open data. The interface will present the visual options for a City Dashboard in a way that reflects different ways of experiencing urban transformation. We will be seeking advice on appropriate front end design tools & interfaces for embedding & structuring live feeds (and other data feeds which are not necessarily real-time).
